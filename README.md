# Nervos Functions

Welcome to Nervos Functions! This repo provides some handy functions for [Nervos Network](https://www.nervos.org).

By combining serverless computing with blockchain technology, several things can happen.

One of the major benefits is that it allows for the creation of decentralized applications that can be easily scaled and maintained. In a serverless blockchain architecture, code is run in stateless functions, making it easier to distribute the workload and manage resources. This can result in improved performance, reduced costs, and increased security.

Another benefit of combining serverless and blockchain is the ability to build smart contracts that can be executed automatically without the need for intermediaries or manual intervention. This can streamline and automate business processes, such as contract execution and payment processing, while ensuring transparency and security.

Overall, combining serverless and blockchain can lead to greater efficiency, scalability, automation, and security for decentralized applications and business processes.
